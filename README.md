# Attendance-Manager
An attendance manager and register for teachers in Node JS that uses student's location and face authentication to for transparency in student's attendance in colleges. It uses Face API.js (https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) for the face identification based on Tensorflow.js and the Geolocation API for determining whether the student is present in the permitted area for the classroom.

We have used MongoDB as the database and JWT for the CRUD operations.

For using the code, clone the Face API.js repository into the ./new_views folder and simply install the necessary packages.

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5000/

Happy Hacking ;)
