# Attendance-Manager
This project was created for the PowerSurge Hackathon of Electra Society. We successfully secured the second position in the hackathon ;)

It is an attendance manager and register for teachers in Node JS that uses student's location and face authentication to for transparency in student's attendance in colleges. For giving an attendance, the student must undergo a face authentication and he/she must be present only in the areas specifically designated by the teachers as classrooms.

It uses Face API.js (https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) for the face identification based on Tensorflow.js and the Geolocation API for determining whether the student is present in the permitted area for the classroom. We have used MongoDB as the database and JWT for the CRUD operations.

For using the code, simply clone the Face API.js repository into the ./new_views folder and install the necessary packages.

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5000/

Happy Hacking ;)
